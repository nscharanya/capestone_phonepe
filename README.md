PhonePe Pulse data visualization and exploration offers an efficient and insightful approach to explore and visualize data, providing a valuable learning experience and a practical tool for data analysis.

# Project Approach : 
1) Extraction of Data: Scripting is used to clone the Github repository and fetch the data into JSON format.
2) Data Conversion: Python and Pandas is used to clean, preprocess, and format the data for analysis.
3) Insertion into Database: The transformed data is inserted into a Postgres database using the psycopg2 library.
4) Making of a Dashboard: Streamlit and Plotly in Python is used to develop an interactive and visually appealing dashboard with geo visualizations.
5) Retrieving Data: Data from the Postgres database will be fetched using psycopg2 and updated dynamically on the dashboard.

This project is a live, user-friendly dashboard providing valuable insights from Phonepe Pulse data, accessible via web browsers. This project ensures a seamless experience for data exploration and visualization.
