PhonePe Pulse data visualization and exploration offers an efficient and insightful approach to explore and visualize data, providing a valuable learning experience and a practical tool for data analysis.

# Project Approach : 
1) Data Extraction: Scripting is used to clone the Github repository and fetch the data into JSON format.
2) Data Transformation: Python and Pandas is used to clean, preprocess, and format the data for analysis.
3) Database Insertion: The transformed data is inserted into a MySQL database using the mysql-connector-python library.
4) Dashboard Creation: Streamlit and Plotly in Python is used to develop an interactive and visually appealing dashboard with geo visualizations.
5) Data Retrieval: Data from the MySQL database will be fetched using mysql-connector-python and updated dynamically on the dashboard.

This project is a live, user-friendly dashboard providing valuable insights from Phonepe Pulse data, accessible via web browsers. This project ensures a seamless experience for data exploration and visualization.
